# Lab Self-Assessment

The questions below will help guide you through our lab’s regular self-assessment process. The purpose is for me (the PI) to figure out how to best mentor you through your time in the lab and onto the next steps in your career trajectory. Please complete this document and email it to me. After this, we will set a time to meet and discuss, then I will provide you a written summary of our discussion via email.

Start by considering the following questions. Your answers may or may not be the same as those from your last self-assessment.

1.	Why are you here in the lab (specifically) and doing research (generally)?
2.	What are your goals for your time here?
3.	What do you want to do in the future?

## Last Assessment

Paste in the summary that we agreed on after your last self-assessment meeting:

## Accomplishments

What have you accomplished since your last self-assessment? (Consider each of the activity categories below, or add other categories as relevant.) How do these accomplishments match your goals from last time? 

-	Coursework/workshops
-	Teaching/mentoring
-	Participation in lab/departmental activities (seminars, etc)
-	Presentations/Conferences (talks, posters, other)
-	Papers/Projects [list current status for each, and status at last self-assessment]
-	Grants [list due date, current status for each, and status at last self-assessment]
-	Paper reviews
-	Job applications [list due dates, letter writers]
-	Outreach

## Specific goals

1.	Ideally, what would you like to have accomplished by your next self-assessment (in ~ 4 months)? Include any activities that weren’t listed above but that you anticipate beginning in the next few months. When relevant, provide estimated soft or hard deadlines for each project (e.g. paper drafts, applications).
2.	What is the minimum that you expect to have accomplished by your next self-assessment?

## Lab citizenship

1.	Are you respectful of others in the lab?
2.	Do you help others? Do you ask others for help?
3.	Do you clean up after yourself?
4.	Are there personality issues you struggle with in the lab? How does it affect your work? What can you do to help alleviate these issues? What can I as the PI do to help?
5.	Are there any challenges or problems related to idea ownership or authorship that you currently face?

## Communication

1.	Do you tell the PI your results/what you are up to regularly? Are you happy with your level of interaction with the PI?
2.	Do you seek out the PI when needed, but operate independently where appropriate?
3.	Do you regularly tell others in the lab what you are doing?
4.	Do you communicate with other people outside of our lab? Who? How does that go?
5.	Are you happy with your level/amount of science discourse?

## Productivity

1.	What do you do to maintain productivity? What are the biggest challenges to your efficiency?
2.	What can you do to remove productivity roadblocks? What can I do as an advisor to help with productivity? What can the lab do?
3.	Do your at-work hours overlap with those of others so you can both help others and benefit from them?
4.	Are you setting priorities and doing research in an order that allows you to get the most done with your time? What are your work priorities? How well do they line up with your goals as a grad student/postdoc?
5.	Are you focused when you are working? What are your biggest challenges to focus? What could you do to improve focus?

## Organization

1.	Do you have a record-keeping system in place (e.g. folders, notebook, electronic documents) to keep track of each of your research projects? Does it work well for you? Is it thorough and up to date? What could be improved with your system?
2.	If you write code, do you comment it well enough that someone else could follow the steps? Do you have some method of version control (e.g. saving old code versions with the date)?
3.	What do you do to track progress? Does it accurately account for your time? Does it reflect your productivity, priorities and goals?
4.	How are you organizing your literature/papers—can you find papers in a timely manner?

## Gain of scientific knowledge and critical thinking

1.	What steps are you taking to expand your scientific knowledge?
2.	What journals do you regularly look at? What literature reviews do you regularly do?
3.	Are you thinking critically about your research? Do you seek out alternative methodological approaches (e.g. by searching the literature or talking to others)?
4.	What on-campus seminars do you regularly attend? Is there a way you could improve your participation/what you learn from these?

<!--
## Lab meeting participation
1.	How well do you feel you ask and answer questions?
2.	Do you volunteer to present? When you present your own research, is your presentation clear and thought out? Where do you struggle? What kinds of things might help you improve your clarity?
-->


## Bigger picture and broad goals

1.	What are some things you would like to change or work on changing? What steps will you take in the coming months to accomplish these goals? What can the PI, the lab, or others in the department do to help you with your goals?
2.	What is one (or a couple) of things you would change about the lab (including supervisory style)?
3.	Is there anything that you would like to get out of the lab/work environment that you are not getting now?
